# Autocorrelation in spatial regression with Machine Learning methods (with a focus on Random Forest)

Short talk for the workshop **Hands on Machine Learning in Ecology** organized by [Marta M. Rufino](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZMe-JxwAAAAJ&hl=es) (MARE, Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon) and [Tiago A. Marques](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SHqH7fMAAAAJ&hl=es) (University of St. Andrews). 

In this talk I focus on the nature and meaning of spatial autocorrelation, and describe how it can be incorporated into spatial regression models fitted with random forest models with the R package [spatialRF](https://blasbenito.github.io/spatialRF/).
